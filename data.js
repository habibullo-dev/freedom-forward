Anat defies the outdated paradigm of men in the factory and women embroidering at home, and in the process uplifts people in need of a trade and employment. Israel’s military siege makes it difficult for Anat to operate, and the ubiquitous checkpoints make it challenging for the brand to get their product abroad, but they do it anyway!"
